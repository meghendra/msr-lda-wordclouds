Munich Security Report    Post Truth  Post West  Post Order   The world is facing an illiberal moment  Across the West and beyond  illiberal forces are gaining ground  From within  Western societies are troubled by the emergence of populist movements that oppose critical elements of the liberal democratic status quo  From outside  Western societies are challenged by illiberal regimes trying to cast doubt on liberal democracy and weaken the international order  And Western states themselves seem both unwilling and unable to effectively tackle the biggest security crises   with Syria as the prime example  The Populist and Anti Globalist Challenge in the West  The Politics of Fear in a Post Truth World  We are living in the days where what we call liberal nondemocracy  in which we lived for the past   years  ends  and we can return to real democracy    VIKTOR ORB√ÅN    NOVEMBER     The whole of the West is turning its back on a failed system of politics    NIGEL FARAGE    NOVEMBER       The past twelve months have been a resounding rejection of the status quo  In several elections and referenda  political outsiders succeeded  while the establishment was dealt major blows  Populist parties are now part of the government in about a dozen Western democracies  And even in countries where populists only received a small share of the vote  they often exert a defining influence by shifting the debate or pressuring mainstream parties to adopt different policy agendas   Economic factors may explain part of the populist rise  incomes for a majority of citizens in industrialized economies have stagnated or fallen between   and     However  in the US  for instance  analyses show that it was  not economic hardship but anxiety about the future that predicted whether people voted for Trump    There is also a cultural backlash against so called  globalism  from which the populist surge draws  The main dividing line in politics runs less and less between left and right but between a liberal cosmopolitan pole and a populist  or even xenophobic authoritarian  one   Populist parties reject the cultural modernization in Western societies and revolt against what they perceive as threats to the nation  ranging from immigration and cosmopolitan elites to international institutions  They dismiss pluralism and liberalism  essential elements of liberal democracies   Populists are experts in the politics of agitation  forming an  axis of fear  across the West that exploits insecurities and grievances of the electorate  often by twisting the facts or even by spreading outright lies that speak to the preconceptions of their supporters  And they may not even be punished by voters for not offering solutions   In his farewell speech  German President Joachim Gauck warned of the dangers for Western democracies   We should remember that if we only accept as fact what we already believe anyway and if half truths  interpretations  conspiracy theories and rumors count every bit as much as the truth  then the path is clear for demagogues and autocrats    With good reason  the editors of the Oxford Dictionaries proclaimed  post truth  the word of the year     Beyond all the dangers for democracy  this also has a very clear security dimension  If politicians  for instance  lie about crowd sizes  say demonstrably wrong things about previously held positions and suggest that falsehoods are merely  alternative facts   can citizens and allies trust them on national security issues   Likewise    Munich Security Report    The DECLINE Decline of THE

democracies depend  The Illiberal International and Cracks in the Liberal International Order  We cannot avoid facing up to this challenge  The fact is that liberal democracy and the political and normative project of the West are under fire    JOACHIM GAUCK    JANUARY     For many decades  we ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry  subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military  we ve defended other nation s borders while refusing to defend our own  and spent trillions of dollars overseas while America s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay  We ve made other countries rich while the wealth  strength  and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon        But that is the past  And now we are looking only to the future        From this moment on  it s going to be America First    DONALD J  TRUMP    JANUARY    The rise of the populists has rapidly become a systemic challenge that threatens to undermine the liberal international order the world s liberal democracies have built and upheld since the end of World War II  The populists watch and learn from each other and increasingly cooperate across borders  Some analysts have already referred to the  Illiberal International   the  Populist International   or the  International of nationalists    Together  the populists at home and the illiberal regimes abroad form a formidable challenge to the main elements of the liberal international order  the spread of liberal democracy  economic interdependence based on free trade  and a strong web of international institutions   which researchers see as major factors contributing to a peaceful international order   First  liberal democracy has become increasingly contested  According to Freedom House    was  the  th consecutive year of decline in global freedom   i e   for a decade  there were more countries with net declines than those with net gains each year   Maybe unsurprisingly  in stark contrast to his predecessors  President Donald Trump s inaugural address did not mention words such as democracy  liberty  or human rights  This does not bode well for liberal values around the world   The global rise of populists poses a dangerous threat to human rights   Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch warns   Too many Western political leaders seem to have lost confidence in human rights values  offering only tepid support    Second  the open international economic order may be unraveling  WTO negotiations have stalled for years  and it seems protectionism may return  Last year  the CETA negotiations between Canada and the European Union came close to failing  and TTIP has almost become a political anathema  Long a champion of free trade  the United States is now on a more protectionist path  In his inaugural address  Trump made a clear case for  America first  after claiming that previous US policy had  enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry  and  the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world   As Trump promised   Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength    Yet  most economists warn of a new mercantilism that would affect precisely those US workers Trump claims to support   Finally  the multilateral institutions at the heart of the international order are at risk as well  To some degree  the weakness of key institutions is the result of the increasing influence of non democratic great powers that have generally benefitted from the liberal international order but do not embrace all its elements  Partly  however  Western countries themselves are to blame for the crisis of this order  They may have pushed too hard to implement some of the normative changes  provoking a backlash against some of the most progressive developments such as the responsibility to protect  R P  or not making room enough for emerging powers within that order  Today  major innovations of the liberal international order such as the International Criminal Court are losing support   Perhaps most importantly  some of its core institutions are increasingly questioned within the Western countries itself  Since its creation  NATO has been a central pillar of the Western led order   and the crucial security link connecting the

Trump s comments about NATO being  obsolete  have caused great uncertainty among America s allies  especially in Central and Eastern Europe  The European Union is under pressure  too  as it has to deal with Brexit  a populist surge  the refugee crisis  a potential return of the euro crisis  jihadist attacks  and a revisionist Russia  And while the Obama administration referred to Europe as  the cornerstone of our engagement with the rest of the world  and  a catalyst for our global cooperation    Donald Trump  a few days before his inauguration  described the EU as a project intended to counter US influence and suggested he did not really care about its future    The world order that we built  our dearest inheritance  which we tended to and shored up every year here at Munich  is coming apart  It is not inevitable that this happen  It is not occurring because we lack power  or influence  or options to employ  No  this comes down  ultimately  to our judgment and our resolve    JOHN MCCAIN    FEBRUARY    Post West or Even Post Order  What does this   especially a much more unilateralist  nationalist US foreign policy   mean for the future international order  Will it slowly become a more fragmented order in which regional hegemons define the rules of the game in their spheres  Or will the Western democracies be able to preserve the core norms and institutions of the liberal international order  Do they even want to  Who is going to provide common public goods that benefit their own country  but also others  The development of some of today s crucial geopolitical hotspots may give us a preview of the emerging disorder and disengagement  In Syria  more than     people died  and millions had to flee their homes  While the Europeans stood by and the United States was reluctant to fully engage  others filled the vacuum  Most decisively  the Russian government took an active role in the conflict when the Syrian regime appeared to be losing  It claimed that it was fighting against the Islamic State  but primarily waged war on the opposition  According to the human rights groups  hospitals were regularly and deliberately targeted   While Western officials have repeatedly argued that  there is no military solution  to the war in Syria  Russia and its allies pursued one   and seem to be successful  Is this the brave new post Western world  The events in Aleppo also may foreshadow the significance of international law and human rights  or lack thereof  in the future  Should a genocide be perpetrated somewhere in the world in the coming months  would anybody step in    If the scope of freedom and respect for the rule of law shrinks around the world  the likelihood of war within and between nations increases  and our own freedoms will eventually be threatened     In Ukraine  Russia has violated several key principles governing European security  Even so  sanctions might be reduced without any progress on implementing the Minsk Agreements  Should the Trump administration strike a meaningful deal with Moscow  this could signal a new era of great powers determining the fate of smaller ones  As several European leaders warned Trump before his inauguration   The rules based international order on which Western security has depended for decades would be weakened   ‚Ä¶  A deal with Putin will not bring peace  On the contrary  it makes war more likely     BARACK OBAMA   Despite its various flaws  the liberal international order has  in the bigger scheme of things  allowed for a remarkable era of peace and economic development  It is  in principle  open to accommodate rising powers and can be adapted to changing circumstances   But a fundamental question has emerged  has the post ColdWar period been merely a liberal interregnum that is giving way to a more illiberal era  Will this new era again be marked by greater tensions and  possibly  even outright conflict between the world s major powers  not least between China and the US  Is this a post order world in which the elements of the liberal international order are fading away because no one is there to protect them  The world is about to find out     JANUARY        Munich Security Report    THE EURASIA GROUP S TOP   RISKS FOR    Each year  Eurasia Group publishes a list of the top   political risk stories for the year ahead  In    as they put it   we enter a period of geopolitical recession  the most volatile political risk environment in the postwar period   These are the trends Eurasia Group believes will define it      Independent America  Donald Trump will use US power overwhelmingly to advance US interests  with little concern for the broader impact  Trump is no isolationist  He s a unilateralist  Expect a more hawkish   and a much less predictable   US foreign policy  Allies  especially in Europe and Asia  will hedge  Rivals like Russia and China will test  US led institutions will lose more of their international clout      China overreacts  The need to maintain control of the transition ahead of next fall s party congress will increase the risk of economic policy mistakes that rattle foreign investors and international markets  President Xi Jinping knows this is a dangerous time to look weak and irresolute  US Chinese tensions might play out to make   a dangerous year      A weaker Merkel  Strong leadership from Angela Merkel has proven indispensable for Europe  which will face more challenges in     from France s elections  Greece s finances  Brexit negotiations to relations with Russia and Turkey  Though Merkel is likely to win reelection  she ll emerge as a weakened figure      No reform  Some leaders  like India s Modi  have accomplished as much as they can for now  In Russia  France  and Germany  reform will wait until after coming elections  and China faces an all consuming leadership transition next fall  Turkey s Erdogan and Britain s May are fully occupied with domestic challenges  In Brazil  Nigeria  and Saudi Arabia  ambitious plans will advance but fall short      Technology and the Middle East  The revolution in energy production undermines the stability of states still dependent on oil and gas exports  New communications technologies enhance the ability of angry citizens to commiserate and organize  Cyber conflict is shifting the region s precarious balance of power  Finally   forced transparency   think Wikileaks  is dangerous for brittle authoritarian regimes      Central banks get political  Western central banks are increasingly vulnerable to the same sort of crude political pressures that distort economies in developing countries  In    there s a risk that Trump will use the Fed as a scapegoat  putting new pressure on future Fed decisions      The White House vs  Silicon Valley  Trump wants security and control  The tech firms want freedom and privacy for their customers  Trump wants jobs  The tech firms want to push automation into overdrive  The two sides also differ substantially on investment in science      Turkey  President Erdogan continues to use an ongoing state of emergency to tighten his control of day to day affairs  In    he ll use a referendum to formalize his powers  and his strengthening grip will exacerbate the country s economic problems and its tense relations with neighbors and with Europe      North Korea  It s hard to know exactly when North Korea will have a missile capability that poses a clear and immediate danger to the US  but the DPRK appears to be approaching the finish line at a time of deteriorating relations between China and the US  A tough Trump policy could roil geopolitics throughout the region  South Africa  Unpopular President Zuma is afraid to pass on power to someone he    doesn t trust  Infighting over succession poses an obstacle to any effort on needed reforms and limits South Africa s ability to help stabilize conflicts in its neighborhood   Source  Eurasia Group       Munich Security Report
