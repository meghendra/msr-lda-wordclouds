Munich Security Report    East Asia  Pacific No More     TPP  was all about the United States showing leadership in the Asia region   …  But in the end  if the US is not there  that void has to be filled  And it will be filled by China    JOHN KEY  THEN PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND  NOVEMBER     China has been taking out massive amounts of money and wealth from the US in totally onesided trade  but won t help with North Korea  Nice!   DONALD J  TRUMP    JANUARY    In East Asia  the risk of a major security crisis is higher than it has been in many years  With the five yearly Central Committee Congress of the Chinese Communist Party scheduled for this fall    President  Xi will be extremely sensitive to external challenges to his country s interests   the Eurasia Group  a risk consultancy  writes   He will be more likely than ever to respond forcefully to foreign policy challenges    In the coming months  such challenges could emanate from numerous hot spots ranging from the South China Sea and Taiwan to North Korea – or from the new US administration  During his confirmation hearings in January    the designated US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson possibly set the stage for a major clash   We re going to have to send China a clear signal that  first  the island building stops and  second  your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed   he said  referring to China s construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea   China has long considered large parts of the South China Sea its own sovereign territory and continues to do so in spite of the recent Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling  which sided with the Philippines  and with the position of most of the international community    However  China seems confident of its growing power and of limited opposition across the region  Some countries are already seeking closer ties with Beijing  perhaps wondering about the durability of the US strategic  rebalancing  to the Asia Pacific  In November    Australia announced that it would now support China led regional trade deals as plans for the US led Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  were unravelling   During an October   visit to Beijing  Philippine President Duterte questioned his country s military agreement with the United States   I announce my separation from the United States   …  America has lost   …  I ve realigned myself in your  China s  ideological flow    Finally  US allies South Korea and Japan are left wondering what the mixed messages coming from the US mean  During the campaign  Donald Trump had suggested that it might  not be a bad thing  if both countries developed nuclear weapons in order to be able to defend themselves against North Korea   The most dangerous regional crisis is likely to emerge over Pyongyang s nuclear weapons program  In defiance of international law  the country has made significant progress in   as its program shifted from  developing a nuclear capability in the abstract to deploying a nuclear armed force of ballistic missiles   as Jeffrey Lewis puts it    It is getting closer to an intercontinental ballistic missile capability that would enable it to hit the US West Coast with a nuclear weapon   It won t happen   Trump tweeted in January     But it is unclear how he intends to prevent this North Korean capability  If the US adds sanctions  including ones that hit Chinese banks   presses China to increase its coercive measures against North Korea  or even opts for military steps  a major US China crisis could be right around the corner  And  at any point  Pyongyang could plunge Northeast Asia into chaos
