 Munich Security Report    EU  Brussels  Clout      Up to of annual European defense investment could potentially be saved through pooling of procurement   MCKINSEY ANALYSIS  DECEMBER     The purpose  even existence  of our Union is being questioned  at a time when  our citizens and the world need a strong European Union like never before    EU High Representative Federica Mogherini said in June  summarizing the core of the EU s tragic dilemma  The past year has seen the rise of populist  anti EU forces across the Union  culminating with the Brexit vote in June  The UK s decision reversed the development toward an  ever closer union  and created a precedent other countries could follow  At the same time  Europe is faced with a wide array of threats  which most experts say can best be tackled through joint European responses  Challenges not only include the ongoing crisis with Russia in the East  protracted wars to the South  or Islamist terrorist attacks in the heart of European cities  but also the uncertainty about the transatlantic security partnership and about the United States  commitment to European security  Over the past months  this has brought more and more Europeans to recognize the need for a strong European Union  Since the British referendum  a mood of  Regrexit  is starting to spread  Across Europe  EU approval ratings have risen to over      Particularly when it comes to the EU s role in the world  a clear majority of EU citizens is now calling for greater engagement   If the EU wants to prove to itself and to its skeptics in and outside Europe that it is capable of being a  superpower that believes in multilateralism and in cooperation    as Federica Mogherini recently put it  a common foreign policy strategy backed with sufficient military power is widely seen as a strategic necessity  In many European capitals  this has already triggered a trend reversal in defense expenditures  According to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg    will be  the third consecutive year of increased defense spending in Europe    Although an average of     percent of GDP spent on defense in European NATO member states  is still far from the Alliance s   percent goal  a new consensus is emerging   Europe can no longer afford to piggyback on the military might of others    Commission President JeanClaude Juncker acknowledged in September  In order to improve joint foreign and security policy making  the EU not only presented a new Global Strategy but has also taken a bundle of concrete measures to boost European cooperation in security and defense as part of the EU Security and Defense Package   Other ideas include a European semester on defense  a  Schengen of Defense   as well as the highly controversial notion of a  European Army   Whether the new momentum will translate into a truly new level of EU cooperation will primarily depend on the member states themselves  Besides having to fill the new framework with policies and instruments  EU countries will have to set aside their differences  including concerns that the new plans will divert resources away from NATO  But when  if not now  should Brussels  clout in the world ever be on top of the menu       Munich Security Report    WHATcitizens CITIZENS What of select EU countries OF SELECT EU think  Should the COUNTRIES THINK  EU play aTHE EU SHOULD
