Places   Munich Security Report    Central and Eastern Europe  Fears of Influence  The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense – and  if not  the US must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves    DONALD J  TRUMP    APRIL     We are united in our efforts to increase our defense and deterrence  but we are also united in our efforts to strengthen the dialogue with Russia   NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg said in July   at the Alliance s Warsaw Summit   In the Polish capital  NATO members agreed on  the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the Cold War   as Stoltenberg put it   The most visible part of the new posture are the multinational battalions in Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  and Poland  led by the framework nations UK  Canada  Germany  and the US  respectively  Russia s violations of the NATO Russia Founding Act notwithstanding  the Allies agreed to remain well below the threshold of  substantial combat forces   usually understood as troop levels exceeding one brigade per host country   At the same time  the Alliance also agreed to reengage with Russia within the framework of the NATO Russia Council  Reinvigorating the dialogue on military incidents  transparency  and arms control has proved difficult  however  Efforts to heighten the transparency of exercises or to update and specify rules to avoid military incidents have yet to produce results  Some already fear an erosion of the remaining arms control agreements and the advent of an escalating arms race in Europe   While the Russian government continues to oppose NATO s Ballistic Missile Defense system  some Western diplomats accuse Russia of violating the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty  which had ended the missile crisis in the  s   At last year s Munich Security Conference  Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev already warned that  we are rapidly rolling into a period of a new cold war      The Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia  But we cannot and will not compromise on the principles on which our Alliance and security in Europe and North America rest    NATO WARSAW SUMMIT COMMUNIQUÉ    JULY       Against this background  some Europeans are hopeful that the Trump administration may forge a new détente with Moscow  Yet  many fear that this would come at their expense  A group of leaders from Central and Eastern Europe publicly warned then President elect Donald Trump of striking a new grand bargain with Moscow   Vladimir Putin is not America s ally  Neither is he a trustworthy international partner  […] A deal with Putin will not bring peace  On the contrary  it makes war more likely    While some US allies are deeply worried about their security  the situation for those outside NATO is even worse  Despite decreasing international attention  the armed conflict in Eastern Ukraine is  far from frozen   as Alexander Hug  the Deputy Chief of the OSCE s Special Monitoring Mission  put it   And although the full implementation of the Minsk agreements seems far away  an increasing number of politicians have speculated about an overhaul of the EU sanctions  which are explicitly linked to those very agreements  As the signatories of the open letter put it   It would be a grave mistake to end the current sanctions on Russia or accept the division and subjugation of Ukraine   For Ukrainians and the rest of Europe    – with upcoming elections in major European countries and a new US administration – will be a critical year    Munich Security Report    RUSSIA S  potential   POTENTIAL  Russia s missile in MISSILE capability CAPABILITY Kaliningrad IN KALININGRAD  Several surface to air missile types presently covering ranges of at least up to   km are currently deployed in Kaliningrad  Several additional defensive and offensive missile systems could be deployed  see map   Russia has on some occasions  as part of exercises  deployed Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad in the past  Russia has also allegedly tested a yet to be fielded ground launched cruise missile which Washington maintains is above the lower threshold of the Intermediate range Nuclear Forces Treaty and thus in breach of the treaty  The cruise missile is believed to have a potential range in excess of     km  Source  The International Institute for Strategic Studies
