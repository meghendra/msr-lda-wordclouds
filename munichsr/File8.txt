 Munich Security Report    Middle East  Meddling Through   The name Aleppo will echo through history  like Srebrenica and Rwanda  as a testament to our moral failure and everlasting shame    JOHN MCCAIN  LINDSEY GRAHAM    DECEMBER    Is a post Western Middle East emerging  As sectarian conflict  civil war  and state failure continue to shape key countries in the region  the US and the EU are struggling to redefine their roles  Meanwhile  other countries are taking the initiative  Turkey has now intervened in Syria and is seeking closer cooperation with Russia  Iran and Saudi Arabia are engaged in multiple conflicts as part of their competition for regional power and influence  Russia continues to be heavily involved in the war in Syria  attempting to reassert its role on the world stage and to break what Russia s Defense Minister Shoigu recently called  the chain of ‘color revolutions  spreading across the Middle East and Africa    Nowhere have the new realities become more apparent than in Syria  Backed by Iran and Russia  President Assad recently achieved his most significant victory  with the fall of Aleppo  the regime is now back in control of the country s four major cities  Moderate opposition forces have been considerably weakened after Turkey ceased its direct military assistance for Aleppo s rebel groups in its rapprochement with the Kremlin  At the same time  Western countries continued to resist opposition calls for greater military support  while Saudi Arabia and the UAE have shifted their focus and resources away from Syria s rebel groups and further towards Yemen  where another protracted and deadly civil war is raging      Aleppo  is the biggest   and I want to emphasize this for all to hear   the biggest international humanitarian action in the modern world    VLADIMIR PUTIN    DECEMBER    While the past months have seen clear outcomes on the battlefield  a diplomatic solution remains out of sight  None of the three ceasefire agreements lasted long enough to pave the way for meaningful peace talks  Since September alone  three UN Security Council resolutions failed to pass due to Russian and Chinese vetoes  After six years of empty calls for Assad to step down  red lines drawn and transgressed with no consequences  and fruitless UN Security Council meetings  the international community is no step closer to a political settlement which all conflict parties can agree to   We will liberate every inch of Syria   Assad stated in June    emphasizing his unwillingness to negotiate and his determination to fight this war at all costs   Particularly for Syria s civil population  this has come at a devastating price  More than half of the population was forced to flee their homes   Under Assad s  starve or surrender  strategy  the death toll has risen to more than      according to various estimates    If you don t take action  there will be no Syrian peoples or Syria to save   UN Humanitarian Coordinator Stephen O Brien warned the UN Security Council in late October     But key Western actors stood by as Aleppo fell  watching what a UN spokesperson described as  a complete meltdown of humanity    As numerous actors are meddling in the crises in Syria and the region  while the West attempts to somehow muddle through  the Middle East s post Western age might have already begun       Munich Security Report
