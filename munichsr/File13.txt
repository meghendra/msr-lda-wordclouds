Actors   Munich Security Report    United States  Trump s Cards   Who plays cards where you show everybody the hand before you play it    Donald Trump said in January   as he explained why he would not yet discuss specific foreign policy plans   For US allies  statements such as this can lead to both hope and worry  The hope is that Trump is trying to keep as many options and bargaining chips as possible  but that the cards he chooses to play may not be as disruptive or confrontational as feared  The worries are that Trump will embark on a foreign policy based on superficial quick wins  zero sum games  and mostly bilateral transactions   and that he may ignore the value of international order building  steady alliances  and strategic thinking  Or  maybe worse  that he sees foreign and security policy as a game to be used whenever he needs distractions for domestic political purposes   On the biggest question of all  from which everything else flows  the question of US responsibility for global order   Trump  clearly has little interest in continuing to shoulder that burden      The US is  for now  out of the world order business    ROBERT KAGAN    NOVEMBER    In terms of his priorities  Trump has stressed repeatedly that fighting jihadist groups  especially Daesh  is his security policy priority  But little else is clear   Mr  Trump s unpredictability is perhaps his most predictable characteristic   Steven Erlanger writes   No one knows where exactly he is headed   except that the one country he is not criticizing is Russia    For now    However  that does not mean Trump lacks core beliefs  In fact  he has consistently held key convictions about America s role in the world since the  s  he has long been a critic of America s security alliances  saying the US pays a lot for them without getting nearly enough in return  He has frequently opposed US trade deals and argued in favor of tariffs  He has often spoken favorably of authoritarian leaders in other countries   Thus   America First  will likely mean a resolutely unilateralist foreign policy   and a foreign policy in which values do not matter much  What is uncertain is how Trump s core beliefs will translate into policy  and whether policies will be coherent   Is NATO  obsolete  or  very important   Trump has said both   Does the US no longer care whether the European Union provides stability throughout the continent   or will the US even actively undermine the EU  How close will the Trump administration s relationship with Russia actually be  considering widely differing positions held by key advisors  Will Trump risk a trade war with China or even a military confrontation in the Pacific  How much deviation from fundamental conservative foreign policy principles will Congressional Republican leaders accept  The consequences for the international order could be tremendous  if the US does retreat  vacuums will be filled by other actors  Key institutions will be weakened  spoilers will be emboldened  And some US allies may see no alternative than to start hedging by seeking out new partners  Others will try to convince the new administration that the US led alliances continue to be a good deal for Washington   and that there is inherent value in long term commitments   After all  successful deals are based on trust  which requires some predictability and is often strongest between countries sharing common values   not between opportunistic leaders  A unilateralist Trump administration may find that it has a different hand than it currently thinks  And once cards are on the table  you cannot pretend you never played them       Munich Security Report    WHAT AMERICAN What American CITIZENS THINK citizens think about

America gives its word  it must mean what it says     James Mattis  Defense Dept     I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia   from a position of strength   is possible  Common sense says this cycle of hostility must end  Some say the Russians won t be reasonable  I intend to find out     Donald J  Trump  If you get along and if Russia is really helping us  why would anybody have sanctions if somebody s doing some really great things     Donald J  Trump  We have a problem with radical Islamism and I actually think that we could work together with  Russia  against

where we can cooperate  and an increasing number of areas in which we will have to confront Russia      the most important thing is that we recognize the reality of what we deal with  with Mr  Putin  and we recognize that he is trying to break the North Atlantic alliance     James Mattis  Russia today poses a danger      It has invaded Ukraine     and supported Syrian forces that brutally violate the laws of war  Our NATO allies are right to be alarmed at a resurgent Russia     Rex Tillerson  State Department    Russia  reasserted itself aggressively  invading and occupying Ukraine
