   Munich Security Report     Forced  Migration  Here to Stay   We are facing a crisis of epic proportions  More than   million people have been driven from their homes    BARACK OBAMA    SEPTEMBER    The global population of forced migrants   including refugees  asylum seekers  and internally displaced persons   continues to grow dramatically  In    it stood at   million people    years later at   million   A significant increase was observed after state structures in North Africa were considerably weakened in the aftermath of the Arab Spring and after the outbreak of the civil war in Syria  Forced migration also took a larger death toll in   than in previous years  an estimated     migrants worldwide died during their voyage  most of them drowned   Last year  developing countries again hosted the lion s share of forcibly displaced persons   while arrivals in Europe have fallen significantly  In    almost     million asylum seekers were counted in Europe  while in the first two quarters of    only     people arrived   A major reason for this is the Turkey EU deal  which came into effect in March   and led to a steep decrease in arrivals in Greece   from     in   to     in    Tragically    saw an increase in total deaths of migrants at European borders   the International Organization for Migration recorded almost     dead migrants in the Mediterranean  up from     in    Thus  the Mediterranean was the world s deadliest migration route in     accounting for almost    of recorded migrant deaths worldwide   Key dynamics that make this an age of forced migration are likely to get even more pronounced in the future  Those include environmental stress  Africa s demographic surplus as well as low fertility rates and skill gaps in developed countries  failing states  and conflict  The war in Syria  in particular  was the single most important event to lead to forced migration in the past years      million Syrians have fled their country since    according to UNHCR   more than a quarter of the entire Syrian population   Management and coordination of large migration flows are key issues to be addressed in the short term  Due to lower influx numbers  inner EU disagreements on refugees and asylum seekers have for now been mitigated  However  the underlying mechanisms aimed at distributing asylum seekers across the European Union have not been fixed  Progress on improving institutional arrangements remains weak  on a European as well as a global level  In September    the host countries of the Leaders  Summit on Refugees   including the US and Germany   recognized  that no routine mechanism exists yet to facilitate the kind of voluntary responsibilitysharing for refugees that was demonstrated today or to more comprehensively address other challenges arising from large scale refugee crises    Thus  unsatisfactory unilateral and ad hoc actions will likely remain the norm   at the expense of some of the most vulnerable populations in the
