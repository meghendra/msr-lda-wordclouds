Issues   Munich Security Report     Dis Information  Fake It  Leak It  Spread It   If the most powerful and richest democracy in the world can have its electoral process derailed through mass disinformation  electronic break ins and doxing  then what awaits the elections next year in Germany  France and the Netherlands  where genuine extremist parties are rapidly gaining popularity    TOOMAS HENDRIK ILVES    DECEMBER    If the referendum debates in the UK or the US election campaign are any indicator  facts matter less and less   Whether it is the spread of fake news  politically motivated leaks of hacked information  the use of trolls  or automated social media bots  these instruments present a grave challenge to informed public debate  Several factors enhance their impact  today s media landscape holds many challenges for quality journalism and is  in many countries  increasingly fragmented  polarized  and politicized  Technological changes  most importantly the rise of social media as a major source of information  create filter bubbles and echo chambers in which only partial sets of information are shared and amplified  In the US  for instance  only   percent of Republicans  have trust in the mass media    All this creates a structure waiting to be exploited â€“ both by populists within our societies and by interested outside actors  In the recent past  Russia has demonstrated a particular ability to use these weaknesses of open societies to further its objectives and cast doubt on democratic institutions  In early January    the US intelligence community released a report in which they assessed with  high confidence  that  Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in   aimed at the US presidential election  Russia s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process  denigrate Secretary Clinton  and harm her electability and potential presidency    This campaign included the hacking of the servers of the Democratic Party  the leaking of emails by party and campaign officials to WikiLeaks and other outlets  as well as the support of fake news outlets and social bots amplifying the message   This has increased worries in other Western democracies  especially in those where elections are scheduled for    Authorities in France and Germany  whose parliament s network was hacked by the same group that broke into the Democratic Party s servers  have already warned of Russian attempts to influence the upcoming elections   Across Europe  the members of a new  Populist International  rely on so called alternative media that regularly spread Kremlin friendly messages or fake news   It seems to pay off  in Germany  a poll in August   showed that   percent of supporters of the populist Alternative for Germany and   percent of left wing voters trust Vladimir Putin more than Angela Merkel   Interestingly  many of the accounts that spread pro Trump information during the US election campaign have now turned to criticizing Angela Merkel and her refugee policy   The main threat is that citizens  trust in media and politicians might further erode  creating a vicious cycle that threatens liberal democracy  States must better protect their hardware  but cyber defense will not be enough  Democratic institutions can also support media literacy  strengthen their communication efforts  and educate their citizens  Yet  they cannot forbid  fake news  or introduce  truth agencies  lest they turn illiberal themselves  Preventing a  post truth  world  in which  nothing is true and everything is possible    is a task for society as a whole        Munich Security Report    WHO is ISopening OPENING Who cultural institutes CULTURAL around the world  INSTITUTES AROUND THE WORLD
