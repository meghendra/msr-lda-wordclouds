Munich Security Report    Foreword  Dear Reader  The annual Munich Security Report  first published in    is our conversation starter for the Munich Security Conference and aims to serve as a useful compilation for decision-makers  security professionals  and the interested public  Ahead of the Munich Security Conference    we are pleased to present the report s third edition  The international security environment is arguably more volatile today than at any point since World War II  Some of the most fundamental pillars of the West and of the liberal international order are weakening  Adversaries of open societies are on the offensive  Liberal democracies have proven to be vulnerable to disinformation campaigns in post truth international politics  Citizens of democracies believe less and less that their systems are able to deliver positive outcomes for them and increasingly favor national solutions and closed borders over globalism and openness  Illiberal regimes  on the other hand  seem to be on solid footing and act with assertiveness  while the willingness and ability of Western democracies to shape international affairs and to defend the rules-based liberal order are declining  The United States might move from being a provider of public goods and international security to pursuing a more unilateralist  maybe even nationalistic foreign policy  We may  then  be on the brink of a post-Western age  one in which non-Western actors are shaping international affairs  often in parallel or even to the detriment of precisely those multilateral frameworks that have formed the bedrock of the liberal international order since    Are we entering a post-order world  How this question will be answered in the years to come will depend on all of us  With this report  we try to make sense of today s security environment by presenting information on important current trends  actors  places  and issues  As in previous editions  the list of topics is neither comprehensive nor exhaustive  This report would not have been possible without the generous support of the numerous renowned institutions  friends  and partners who made their research and data available to the Munich Security Conference  I wish you an interesting and thought-provoking read! Sincerely yours   Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger Chairman of the Munich Security Conference
