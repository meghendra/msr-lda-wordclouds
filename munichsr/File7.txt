  a spokesperson of Daesh requested of its followers last year  Looking at Germany alone  for example  the number of jihadists joining the fight in Syria and Iraq has dropped precipitously  in    hundreds of fighters emigrated to the  caliphate   and some to join Jabhat al Nusra   Today  that flow has all but stopped  and some have even returned from the Middle East  Thus  more potential attackers are in Germany  In addition to those terrorists directed by Daesh  those inspired by the group but without direct links have also become a growing challenge  in Orlando and in Nice  for example   For security services  these are even more difficult to detect  Only by further stepping up EU anti terror cooperation and capabilities will European states be able to rise to what will likely be a long term jihadist challenge  Main reasons for this include the growing potential recruitment pool in Europe  more jihadist entrepreneurs and local network builders  including an increasingly strong crimeterror nexus  the ongoing conflicts in the Muslim world which can be used for recruitment and propaganda  and the clandestine communication opportunities the Internet provides   But not just in Europe  much work on the way to crippling Daesh  and jihadism  in general  remains to be done  Recently  Daesh s leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi reminded his followers that there was a  wide path  available for them to act   beyond the West  Iraq  and Syria   in other proclaimed Daesh provinces  e g   in Nigeria  Libya  or Afghanistan   So while the loss of its main sanctuary in Syria and Iraq would mean a major setback for Daesh  its militants will not just disappear  Moreover  without enhanced efforts toward stabilization  reconstruction  and political progress  the military advances in Iraq and Syria will be insufficient  And  finally  with Daesh under pressure  other jihadist groups  not least Al Qaeda  are geared for a resurgence  Even without a caliphate and a state  jihadist groups will continue to inspire youths to join their cause       Munich Security Report    How HOW many MANY people PEOPLE have Germany to HAVE left LEFT GERMANY join jihadist groups in TO JOIN JIHADIST Iraq and IN Syria  GROUPS IRAQ AND  Departures per quarter  January     June         Returnees Deceased       SYRIA     I                                    II  III    IV                 I  II  III              IV        I        II        III              IV          I  II     Source  German Federal Criminal Police Office  BKA   German Federal Office for the Protection of the Prosecution  BfV   Hessian Information and Competence Centre Against Extremism  HKE    HOW much MUCHterritory How TERRITORY HAS in has Daesh lost Syria and Iraq DAESH LOST IN SYRIA  between January AND IRAQ  BETWEEN   and  December JANUARY AND     DECEMBER      Islamic State controlled areas  no change in    Islamic State territorial gains in   Islamic State territorial losses in    Key towns cities Territory controlled by other actors Unpopulated desert areas  Islamic State territorial losses in    Source  IHS Conflict Monitor       Munich Security Report    A LOOK AT RECENT DAESH PROPAGANDA  SHIFTING STRATEGIES AND TACTICS   A wide path  beyond Syria Iraq   We  remind all our Muslim brothers that if the paths have become restricted and the routes of migration to Iraq and Syria cut off  then Allah has made a wide path for them to migrate to those blessed provinces  Afghanistan and Pakistan  Bangladesh  Indonesia  the Caucasus  the Philippines  Yemen  the  Arabian  Peninsula  the Sinai  Egypt  Algeria  Tunisia  Libya  Somalia  West Africa  to establish there a fortress of Islam   Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi  November     Revolt everywhere!
