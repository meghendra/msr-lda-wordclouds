Munich Security Report    Defense Innovation  Changing Gear   Achieving sustainable growth  in industry  is not just about chasing government contracts  its about investing in innovation    ADM MARK FERGUSON  USN  RET Defense has traditionally been one of the hardest industries to disrupt due to high entry barriers  low risk tolerance  and the high level of specialized technical knowledge required  However  the digital revolution sweeping through other industries is now increasingly disrupting defense as well  Digitization is changing both where and how defense companies compete  First  the  where to compete  is shifting from  traditional  defense to IT based products  New battlefields like cybersecurity and big data analytics have allowed pure IT players to gain a foothold in the security and defense business  and budgets for these areas are on track to grow faster than those for  traditional  defense  The share of the US Department of Defense budget allocated to the areas of C   intelligence  and space has doubled since     The four digital giants Google  Amazon  Microsoft  and Intel alone spend more than USD   billion a year on digital innovation  with dual use  offering militaries an opportunity to innovate within constrained defense budgets   Second  digitization is changing the factors that differentiate defense solutions  meaning the  how to compete  is changing too  The increasing digitization of weapon systems   Defense impacts and even disrupts the very core of defense  This development is best evidenced by shifts in technology investment  While military platforms have long been pieces of  embedded software   the ratio of  software  to  hardware  has changed more rapidly and significantly in recent years  As the absolute value of electronics in a platform has almost tripled from one generation to the next   advancement in this area has become the driver of innovation  The extent to which the door is open for disruption by new civilian players can best be seen in the  New Space  industry  Ministries of defense  established defense companies as well as their suppliers  especially tier   and tier    all face the need to adapt their ways of doing business  Externally  they must demonstrate the ability and willingness to engage with nontraditional companies in non traditional processes  One approach involves using  innovation units  and  hubs  to move closer to civilian innovation  Internally  procurement processes could focus on overcoming the disconnect between lengthy procurement cycles and shorter innovation cycles  Experiments with non traditional methods such as competitions and direct awards for prototype technologies have proven successful  A ministry of defense strategy for sustained technology development should allow for an outside in innovation process  a streamlined approach to defining requirements  and simplified procurement of digital technologies  New forms of partnering with emerging tech companies will also be needed  Traditional defense contractors will face the challenge of introducing digital innovation cells within their companies and identifying candidates for mergers or acquisitions  along with competitive pressure to digitize their industrial processes  New strategies will therefore be essential for  traditional defense  to sustain growth in the Defense     era  while maintaining a technological edge is mission critical for militaries as well  This page was prepared by MSCs knowledge partner McKinsey & Company      Munich Security Report    THE commercial INCREASED Are disruptors ROLE OF taking a role  COMMERCIAL DISRUPTORS  US Department of Defense Major Defense Acquisition Program  MDAP  funding  by program original vendor  percent Commercial Derived from commercial Pure defense Source  McKinsey VisualDoD  based on US DoD selected acquisition reports    NEW SPACE   New Space  showcases SHOWCASESincreased investment INCREASED in innovation INVESTMENT IN  Global investment into New Space  USD millions      bn     bn  INNOVATION Number of transactions  Global investment into New Space  by investor group  known investors only  based on volume   percent Corporate     Private equity     Venture capital High net worth individuals New Space  is defined as new players in aerospace  est  later than    with disruptive and significantly lower cost operating model vs  traditional defense primes Source  McKinsey SILA; S&P Capital IQ; PitchBook Data  Inc; CB Insights Munich Security Report  Munich Security Report
