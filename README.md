# msr-lda-wordclouds
Topic Modeling using LDA, and visualization using wordclouds on the [Munich Security Report 2017](http://report.securityconference.de/).
The script generates word clouds for the top 50 terms in 14 topics from the Munich Security Report 2017. I chose 14 because there were 14 articles including the Foreword in the report. The wordclouds for some of the 14 topics are as follows:

![Topic 0](/images/0.png)

![Topic 2](/images/2.png)
![Topic 3](/images/3.png)
